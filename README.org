* TODO multi-gpu process launching works, yet there is an error (shouldn't lightning take care of devices? idk what to do with it rn)
OK apparently there is no sustainable way to launch PEFT in DDP or FSDP setting

* TODO implement brio based on Vasek's code
Too long to generate on the whole train set. Is it worth it?
